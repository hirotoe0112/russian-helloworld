## Practice & Application
<!-- How did you practice what you learned? -->

I practiced by reading some dialogues from the text.

## Challenges & Difficulties
<!-- What was difficult today? -->

Typing in Russian is challenging. I sometimes confuse the characters that look the same as English characters. Additionally, switching the IME is a bit frustrating.

I enjoyed today's study session except for that.

## Strategies to Improve
<!-- What will you do to overcome today’s challenges? -->

Study Russian every day! In fact, I have not studied Russian for over a week, which made me forget some of what I learned.

## Progress & Achievements
<!-- What improvements have you noticed? Celebrate small wins! -->

I really enjoyed reading the dialogues, and the fact that I was able to understand them strongly motivated me!

## Reflection
<!-- How do you feel about today’s learning session? -->

Reading foreign languages as they are is a great joy for me.

## Tools & Resources Used
<!-- List any apps, websites, or books you used today. -->

## Final Thoughts
<!-- Write anything else that comes to mind about your language learning journey. -->

I have not decided whether to apply for the Russian exam yet... I might pass it if I study consistently, but...
